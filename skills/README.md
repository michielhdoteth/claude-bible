# Skills

Reusable skill files for Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, and AI-assisted development workflows. Each skill provides a specialized set of instructions for a specific task domain. Skills are the building blocks of consistent, high-quality AI interactions.

## What Are Skills?

Skills are structured instruction sets that tell an AI assistant how to handle a specific type of task. Unlike ad-hoc prompting, skills encode domain expertise, best practices, and quality standards into reusable files. They work across multiple AI coding assistants including Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, Windsurf, and Roo.

## Skill Categories

### Spec-Driven Development
The dominant pattern in the ecosystem is **spec-first, code-second, test-always**. Top frameworks enforce:
1. Write the spec/design doc first
2. Get approval before implementation
3. Write failing tests before code
4. Implement until tests pass
5. Review and verify before closing

### Fresh-Context Subagents
Each subagent task gets a clean context window to avoid context rot. This is critical for long-running projects where accumulated context degrades AI performance.

### Verification Gates
Every task ends with explicit verification before marking complete. No task is closed without evidence.

## How to Create Skills

Skills follow a standard format. At minimum, a SKILL.md file should include:
- **Purpose**: What this skill does (one paragraph)
- **Workflow**: Step-by-step instructions
- **Rules**: Constraints and requirements
- **Output format**: What the result should look like

See the skill files in this directory for examples.
